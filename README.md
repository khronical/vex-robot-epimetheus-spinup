# Robot "Epimetheus" -  VEX Spin Up!
This repository contains the source code for **Epimetheus**, a VEX V5 competition robot programmed for the **2022â€“2023 Spin Up! season**.

This project was started using the VEX Competition Code Template.

Features I wrote for this code is includes driver-control logic written in **Python** using **VEXcode** in the style of a console controller.

I was gonna write code that allowed the robot to be autonomous but my team ran out of time unfortunately, mainly because we started out pretty late and barely had a working robot.
